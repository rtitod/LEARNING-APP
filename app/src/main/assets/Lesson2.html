</head>
<body>
<h1>Word Stress and Syllables</h1>
<p>
    In English, word stress and syllables play an important role in pronunciation. Word stress refers to the emphasis placed on certain syllables within a word. Understanding word stress will help you speak English more naturally and be better understood by native speakers.
</p>
<h2>Syllables</h2>
<p>
    A syllable is a unit of sound in a word that contains a single vowel sound. English words can have one or more syllables. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Single-syllable words: cat, dog, fish</li>
    <li>Two-syllable words: ba-by, ta-ble, pa-per</li>
    <li>Three-syllable words: com-pu-ter, ho-tel, res-tau-rant</li>
</ul>
<h2>Word Stress</h2>
<p>
    Word stress refers to the syllable in a word that receives the most emphasis. In many English words, one syllable is stressed more than the others. This is called the primary stress. Other syllables in the word may have a weaker stress, known as secondary stress.
</p>
<p>
    In two-syllable words, the stress is often on the first syllable. For example, in the word "ba-by," the stress is on "ba." However, there are exceptions, and some two-syllable words have stress on the second syllable.
</p>
<p>
    In longer words with three or more syllables, the stress can be on any of the syllables. Learning the stress patterns of common words will help you improve your pronunciation and fluency.
</p>
<h2>Practice</h2>
<p>
    Practice saying the following words with the correct word stress:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>te-le-phone</li>
    <li>in-ter-est-ing</li>
    <li>ex-am-ple</li>
    <li>un-der-stand</li>
    <li>ap-pre-ci-ate</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Pay attention to which syllables receive the most emphasis, and try to imitate the natural rhythm of the words. With practice, you'll become more confident in your spoken English and be able to communicate more effectively.
